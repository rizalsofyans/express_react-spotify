# Spotify App

## About

In this project, I implement that what I learn before; Express.js, OAuth, API, and any others!

---

## What is OAuth?

-   OAuth is an authorization protocol
-   Authorize without giving away credentials
-   Use access token in API request

## The OAuth Flow

1. Client request authorization to access data from Spotify
2. Spotify authorizes access to client
3. User grants app access to their Spotify data
4. Client receives access token from Spotify
5. Client uses access token to request data from Spotify
